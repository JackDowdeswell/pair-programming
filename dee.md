On your local machine and in your local repo, create a markdown file
The file name should be your name
The extension should be .md
Add a line or 2 of text - something interesting to share with your colleague(s)
Stage (add) and commit the file
Perform a git pull
Perform a git push - remember you may have to set the upstream (git push -u origin main would usually do it)
If you now have markdown files for all members of your team, you're done!
If you don't, wait until the other(s) have pushed and perform another git pull
